          I'm a <b>front-end web developer</b> coming from the background of a
          professional musician. But these things aren't all that different.
          Being a <b>musician</b> and <b>comedian</b> means developing a
          relationship with the <b>audience</b> and making my taste in music fit
          with what <b>THEY</b> want. It also means lots of experience working
          on <b>teams</b> and with other <b>people</b> in real world settings.
          As a <b>front-end web developer</b> I relish the <b> opportunities</b>{' '}
          to figure out what <b>clients</b> want, and implement that{' '}
          <b>efficiently</b>, effectively, and with a little bit of{' '}
          <b>humor </b>
          and <b>music</b> thrown in where possible.
